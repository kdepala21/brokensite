			<h1>Hey, I'm Kush</h1>
			<p> Nice to meet you. I am a 21 year old student at the School of Oriental and African Studies. I look mostly at Sanskrit, and the Study of Religion. But I am also interested in anything to do with the South Asian region, politics, arts, text, technology, and intersectionality between any of these. I like hackdays, interesting talks and solving difficult problems.</p>
			<p> I've worked at a few startups in the past. These are:
			<ul> <a href="http://www.nexmo.com"> Nexmo</a> as a Sales Development Representitive </ul>
			<ul> <a href="http://www.gocardless.com"> GoCardless</a> in Marketing, and Business Development </ul>
			</p>
			<p> You can find out more about it on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/kushdepala"> Linkedin</a> page. I'm currently looking for exciting and cool things to do.</p>
			<p> We can keep in touch there, or over on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kush_depala">Twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:kush@foryouby.me">email</a> </p>
